# All lines starting with # are ignored.
# These test cases are captured from real Wordle game I played.

# Line start with '=' followed by a word indicates the beginning of a test case. That word is the correct answer.
# Then we have 1-6 lines of guesses. Each guess contains the word we guessed and the outcome. They are separated by space.
# Finally we have a blank line to indicate end of a case.
